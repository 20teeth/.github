# 20t

20t is a student-run Hack Club community based in Brazil. We build real projects and learn by shipping.

What we do:
- Monthly build cycles (projects shipped regularly)
- Open collaboration (GitHub issues/PRs, reviews, documentation)
- Welcoming space for beginners and experienced builders

Who can join:
- Our community spaces are intended for high school students (generally 18 or younger).
- If you're unsure, ask a maintainer before joining.

Projects:
- `website` — the official 20t site
- `discord-bot` — server onboarding and automation
- `shipyard` — publishing monthly projects to public demo URLs

How to contribute:
- Check each repo’s `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Open an Issue or start with a small PR
- Help with code, docs, design, testing, or ideas

Community:
- Discord: https://discord.gg/yFnxh7hur3
- Code of Conduct: See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in our repos

We believe the best way to learn is to build. If you want to ship with us, you’re welcome here.
