# Contributing to 20t

Thanks for your interest in contributing to 20t! We’re a student-run Hack Club community that builds real projects openly. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: code, documentation, design, tests, ideas, and feedback.

## Who can contribute
- Anyone can contribute to public repositories.
- Community spaces (Discord, events, meetings) are intended for high school students (generally 18 or younger). If you're unsure, ask a maintainer.

## Before you start
- Be respectful and follow our Code of Conduct.
- Check existing Issues and Pull Requests to avoid duplicate work.
- If you’re proposing a larger change, open an Issue first to discuss.

## Ways to contribute
- Fix bugs or improve reliability
- Add features (small, well-scoped changes are easiest to review)
- Improve documentation (READMEs, guides, examples)
- Improve UX/design (icons, layout, consistency)
- Add tests or CI improvements
- Refactor for clarity (no behavior change)

## Project workflow (recommended)
1. **Find or create an Issue**
   - If the change is non-trivial, open an Issue describing:
     - what you want to change
     - why it matters
     - a suggested approach

2. **Fork or create a branch**
   - If you have write access: create a branch in the repo
   - Branch naming:
     - `fix/<short-name>`
     - `feat/<short-name>`
     - `docs/<short-name>`
     - `chore/<short-name>`

3. **Make changes**
   - Keep changes focused.
   - Prefer clear, readable code over clever code.
   - Add/update docs when behavior changes.

4. **Test your changes**
   - Run existing tests if available.
   - If no tests exist, add manual steps in the PR description.

5. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Fill out the PR template.
   - Link the related Issue (e.g., “Closes #123”).

## Commit messages (guideline, not strict)
Use clear messages that explain the change:
- `feat: add ...`
- `fix: handle ...`
- `docs: update ...`
- `chore: ...`

## Code quality and style
- Follow existing style patterns in the repository.
- Avoid large formatting-only PRs unless requested.
- Keep functions small and name things clearly.
- Add comments only when needed to explain “why”, not “what”.

## Security and secrets
- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, tokens, passwords).
- If you find a vulnerability, follow `SECURITY.md` and report privately.

## Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repository’s license (see `LICENSE` if present).
