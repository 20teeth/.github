# Code of Conduct

20t is a student-run community for building and learning together. We want a safe, welcoming environment for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Discord/community spaces
- Events, calls, and meetups

## Our values
- Be kind and constructive
- Assume good intent, but prioritize impact over intent
- Help others learn and grow
- Keep the space safe and welcoming

## Expected behavior
- Use respectful language and tone
- Give constructive feedback focused on the work, not the person
- Be inclusive and considerate of different backgrounds and skill levels
- Ask before DM’ing someone repeatedly or adding them to team efforts
- Respect boundaries and privacy

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, threats, bullying, or intimidation
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Sexual content or sexually explicit behavior in community spaces
- Sharing personal information (doxxing) or encouraging others to do so
- Posting private conversations/screenshots without consent
- Scams, phishing, malicious links, or attempts to compromise accounts
- Disruptive spam or behavior that derails collaboration

## Safety and age-appropriateness
We keep community spaces appropriate for a mixed-age student audience. If you’re unsure whether something is appropriate, don’t post it.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness a violation:
- Contact maintainers privately (preferred)
- Do not escalate publicly

Reporting channels:
- Discord: https://discord.gg/yFnxh7hur3
- Slack: https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0AB46SAF43

We will take reports seriously and handle them as discreetly as possible.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may take action to protect the community. Actions may include:
- Warning
- Content removal
- Temporary mute/timeout (community spaces)
- Restriction from interaction (issues/PRs)
- Temporary or permanent ban from community spaces or repositories

Severe violations may result in immediate action.

## Acknowledgements
This code is inspired by common open source community standards and adapted for a student-led environment.
