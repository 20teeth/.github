# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Please help us keep 20t projects safe for everyone.

## Supported versions
Security fixes will be applied to:
- the default branch (usually `main`)
- currently deployed/active releases when applicable

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately via one of the following:
1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred if enabled)
   - Go to the repo → Security → “Report a vulnerability”
2. **Private contact**
   - Email: mmmatheushenriqueee@gmail.com *if is urgent*
   - Slack (private): https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/team/U08RL8T0HJA

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if safe)
- Affected components/paths
- Any logs or screenshots that help

## What happens next
- We’ll acknowledge your report as soon as we can.
- We’ll investigate and determine severity.
- We’ll work on a fix and coordinate a responsible disclosure when appropriate.

## Please do not
- Publicly disclose details before a fix is available
- Attempt to access data you don’t own or have permission to access
- Disrupt services (e.g., DoS, spam) while testing

Thanks for helping keep our community safe.
